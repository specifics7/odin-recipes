        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Torta de Jamon is essentially a Mexican ham sandwich. It was popularized 
            by the Mexican TV show, El Chavo. The show was about a homeless boy who 
            lived in a barrel and would crave for a torta in pretty much every episode.
            There are many ways this sandwich can be prepared and options of meats that
            can be used, but for this recipe we will stick to the ham style version.
