            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A gordita is a traditional Mexican food. It is a pocket of masa harina 
                (corn dough), similar to a thick tortilla. It is cooked on 
                a griddle and sometimes deep fried. After that it is split open and 
                stuffed with various savory fillings such as meats, beans, cheese, or 
                vegetables.
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup masa harina (instant corn masa flour), such as Maseca</li>
                <li>1 cup hot water, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon shortening</li>
                <li>1 cup canola oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>
                    Stir masa harina, water, and salt together in a large bowl until 
                    combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk flour and baking powder together in a small bowl until 
                    combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gradually stir flour mixture and shortening into masa harina 
                    mixture, using clean hands when mixture is cool enough to touch. 
                    If dough seems dry, add more hot water, 1 to 3 teaspoons at a 
                    time, until dough is somewhat clay-like in texture, evenly 
                    moistened, and tacky but not sticky.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Evenly divide and roll dough into 6 balls (about 2 1/2 inches 
                    or 2 3/4 ounces each); keep covered with plastic wrap while 
                    working.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Line a work surface with waxed paper or plastic wrap; sprinkle 
                    lightly with water. Working with one ball at a time, flatten balls 
                    on the wet surface into a 5 1/2-inch disc (about until about 1/8-inch 
                    thick). Transfer discs to a waxed paper- or plastic wrap-lined 
                    baking sheet; keep covered with plastic wrap while working with 
                    remaining dough. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a griddle or comal over medium heat. Working in batches if 
                    needed, cook gorditas until dry to the touch with some small, 
                    very lightly golden spots, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place 
                    gorditas in a single layer, uncovered, on large plates or a large 
                    baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat 
                    until hot enough to bubble immediately when edge of gordita is 
                    dipped in. Fry gorditas, one by one, until puffed, gently pressing 
                    it down into the oil occasionally with a spatula, about 45 seconds 
                    per side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain briefly on paper towels, then cut crosswise to create an 
                    opening large enough to stuff gorditas full of your favorite foods. 
                    Enjoy!
