            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Carne Asada is a common Mexican dish featuring skirt or flank steak
                that is then marinated with limes and other seasonings. It usually 
                grilled and can be served with other side dishes like rice or beans. 
                This recipe will involve a flavorful marinade to soak the steak with 
                before grilling.

            <h3>Carne Asada:</h3>

            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice 
                    for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy 
                    sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle 
                    pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the 
                    marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and 
                    refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer 
                    bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with 
                    the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the 
                    marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 
                    for 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, 
                    and lightly oil the grate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the 
                    remaining marinade.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 
                    minutes per side for medium-rare.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade 
                    over top. Serve immediately.
